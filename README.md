In our recent hackathon project, we developed a comprehensive professional development app. It includes:

    Career Path Planning: Users can create and navigate their career paths, setting goals and milestones for success.

    Interest Committees: Discover and join committees relevant to your profession for networking and discussions.

    Course Recommendations: Access personalized course recommendations from platforms like Coursera and Udemy to enhance your skills and knowledge.

Our app provides a one-stop solution for career growth, networking, and skill development.
